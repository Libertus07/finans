## 2026-01-11 - Rendering Optimization in `Products.jsx`
**Learning:** React components that render large lists inline within the render function are susceptible to unnecessary re-renders when unrelated state (like a counter in a different part of the UI) changes. This is because the parent component re-renders, and the inline map function creates new JSX elements for the entire list every time.
**Action:** Extract list items into separate components (e.g., `ProductListItem`) and wrap them in `React.memo`. Crucially, ensure that all callback functions passed to these memoized components are wrapped in `useCallback` to maintain stable references, otherwise the optimization is voided. Also, use `useMemo` for derived data like filtered lists to prevent recalculation on every render.
